At first I just simply looped through the matrix and swaped them, then I could invert the numbers on a second pass. I then realized that it was redundant to go through this process if the numbers were no equal. I also realized that if the front and the back of my comparison were equal I did not really have to swap, just invert each of them. I also opted to iterate with the loop with iteratos. It looks shorter this way.
