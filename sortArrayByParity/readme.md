My first thought was to have two dynamic arays, one for even and one for odd. At the end we could combine them. The problem with this is that we might need to resize the two arrays/vectors since we dont know before  hand what the amount of even and odds. Then I tough that it would be nice if we could add to the front or the back if it is even or odd respectifully. The data structure that allows you to do this in constatn time is a double ended queue. After making this queue I could just fill the array with the content of the double ended queue. This soulustion is clean and runs in O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
